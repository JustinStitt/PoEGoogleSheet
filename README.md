**How to Use:**		

Make a copy of [this speadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tFraR4DdNRQd81AuYg2kV-JaU_JX7D8RphiAcxNuQfM/edit?usp=sharing) and save to your google drive (File -> Make Copy)			

* Buy breachstones and log them on the left		

* set your 'cost per run'		

* invite leechers to your lobby and append their name to the list in Run Tracker	

* set the increment (labelled 'inc') to the amount of runs a person is buying		

* click the chaos orb by the leecher's name to log their payment						

* copy/paste (ctrl+c,ctrl+v) the current lobby at cell D14 to your party chat		

* now...do a stone run	

* after the run, click the breachstone artwork to decrement each leecher's run count by 1				

* if any leechers are at 0, retrade them to get them paid up						
						
**Other Utilities	**					

* Track exalts! Click the exalt icon to add 1 to counter				

* Queue to join! if a leecher requests to join but you are full, copy/paste their name for future reference		

* Map Counter! count the maps you've gained (do this via dump tab after a batch of runs, not per stone run)		

* reset names! starting a fresh lobby? reset all leecher names
